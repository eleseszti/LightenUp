# Lighten Up

Lighten Up is a simple game created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Description

King Luminar would like his castle to be the brightest around the world - there is only one problem: he is a bit cheap. He wants to use as little amount of lightbulbs as possible and he needs your help to achieve this. Unfortunately, the castle has lots of nooks and crannies - you need to light up all of the corridors, but don't waste the expensive bulbs!

## How To Play

You need to place lightbulbs on the white cells until all of them turn yellow. The numbers in the black cells show how many lightbulbs need to be around them (below, above, left or right - diagonal doesn't count!). They'll be on your help - the numbers turn green when the appropriate amount of lightbulbs are around them.

Be sure not to waste the lightbulbs though! There is no need for two of them in one corridor! In this case, they will warn you by turning red.

Play until all the corridors are lightened and King Luminar's castle is the brightest around the whole world!
